# Art_Net_node
It's a node for the Art-Net protocol with 4 universes on 4 dmx outputs. It can be controlled with 3 buttons and an OLED display. Maybe i will include a web interface also.

## CAD Model
Its two parted and with a little modification can be made with a metal sheet. Now the connection is with heat inserts and screws.
